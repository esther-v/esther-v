Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project named "Sweet Escape" using MERN stack. It is related to travel : it enables to search for and post travel tips (nice places, restaurants, hostals...) and to find co-travellers.
- 🌱 I’m learning Reactjs, Nodejs, Express, MySQL for 8 months. The more I discover programming in JS, the more I love it 👩‍💻
- ⚡ I am a curious person. I love learning and discover new things.
